# A small blogging engine written in Python using the Flask framework. This would be used to host theburningcode.com.

Currently, I'm planning on the following features:-

	1. Main page containing a list of all the blog posts with links (and maybe a small summary).

	2. Magic URLs to individual posts, each having it's own title in the url itself.

	3. A decent, minimalistic but good looking design. Use CSS3. Uh...learn CSS3 as well!

	4. Templates should automatically pick up contents from the post files and render them. Try experimenting with Markdown to write and jijna to generate? (or something like that...)

	5. Storage in a NOSQL Database? Mongo-DB or Redis? Or Maybe in a traditional PostgreSQL database.

That's it for now. Don't think I need anything more than that in a simple blog, so that's it!
